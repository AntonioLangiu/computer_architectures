    - the first is the number he choose
    - the sum of the first and the second is the sum he is guessing
  - the computer ask two numbers
    - the first indicates the number the user choised
    - the second indicated the number the user thinks the computer choised
  - the computer verify if the sum he is guessing is equal to the sum of the first numbers
  - the computer verify if the second number given by the user is equal to the first number choose by him
  - the computer return the answer considering also the parity
